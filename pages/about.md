### Welcome to My DS/AI & Dhamma Journey
This blog is my personal space to document and share everything I learn on my path to becoming a **Data Scientist** and **Machine Learning Engineer** — while also reflecting on **Dhamma, mindfulness, and life lessons** that guide me along the way.

Here, I explore both the **outer world of data** and the **inner world of awareness** — connecting logic with reflection, code with clarity, and technology with wisdom.

### Why I Started This Blog
I believe that learning becomes more meaningful when shared.
Writing about what I study not only deepens my understanding but also helps others walking a similar path — whether it’s in **Data Science** or in **self-understanding through Dhamma**.

This site serves as a **public learning and reflection journal** — a place to organize my notes, record experiments, and write about insights from both data and daily life.

### What You’ll Find Here

* Notes and tutorials on **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI** fundamentals
* Step-by-step **project walkthroughs** and **Python implementations**
* Key takeaways from **books, papers, and courses**
* **Reflections** on challenges, discipline, and learning from mistakes
* Writings inspired by **Dhamma**, **mindfulness**, and **life experiences**

### My Goal
To build a strong foundation in **Data Science and Machine Learning**, and eventually contribute to meaningful **AI solutions** — while cultivating **clarity of mind, compassion, and consistency** in daily life.

I see this journey not just as a technical pursuit, but as a **practice of understanding reality** — through data and through Dhamma.
