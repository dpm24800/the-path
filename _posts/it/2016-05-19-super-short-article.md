# 🧮 Mean — The Measure of Central Tendency

The **mean** (or **average**) is one of the most fundamental statistical concepts.
It gives us a single number that represents the **center** of a dataset — a way to summarize all values into one representative figure.

---

## 🔹 1. Mathematical Definition

If you have ( n ) data points ( x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n ), the **mean** is calculated as:

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \cdots + x_n}{n}
$$

or simply: 

$$\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$$


---

### 🧮 Example:

Let’s say you have the following dataset:
$$
X = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
$$

Then:
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
$$

✅ The **mean** is **6**, meaning the “center” of this data lies around 6.

---

## 🔹 2. Why Mean Matters

* **Gives overall trend:** Represents the “average” behavior of data.
* **Useful for comparison:** e.g., average income, average temperature, etc.
* **Foundation for other metrics:** Used in calculating variance, standard deviation, covariance, etc.

However, mean is **sensitive to outliers**.
For example, [2, 4, 6, 8, 100] → Mean = 24, which doesn’t represent most data points well.

---

## 🔹 3. Mean in NumPy

NumPy provides multiple ways to compute mean efficiently:

### ✅ Basic Example:

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

mean_value = np.mean(data)
print("Mean:", mean_value)
```

**Output:**

```
Mean: 6.0
```

---

### ✅ Mean Across Axes:

If you have a 2D array, you can compute mean across rows or columns.

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6],
                [7, 8, 9]])

print("Mean of all elements:", np.mean(arr))
print("Mean of each column:", np.mean(arr, axis=0))
print("Mean of each row:", np.mean(arr, axis=1))
```

**Output:**

```
Mean of all elements: 5.0
Mean of each column: [4. 5. 6.]
Mean of each row: [2. 5. 8.]
```

---

### ✅ Weighted Mean:

If some data points are more important, use **`np.average()`** with weights.

```python
values = np.array([10, 20, 30])
weights = np.array([1, 2, 3])

weighted_mean = np.average(values, weights=weights)
print("Weighted Mean:", weighted_mean)
```

**Output:**

```
Weighted Mean: 23.333333333333332
```

Here, higher weights make `30` influence the mean more.

---

## 🔹 4. Real-Life Example

Suppose we have student marks from 5 subjects:

```python
marks = np.array([78, 82, 69, 90, 76])
mean_marks = np.mean(marks)
print("Average marks:", mean_marks)
```

**Output:**

```
Average marks: 79.0
```

So the student’s average score across subjects is 79.

## 🔹 5. Summary

| Concept                   | Description                              |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Formula**               | $$ \bar{X} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} $$         |
| **NumPy Function**        | `np.mean()` or `np.average()`            |
| **Sensitive to Outliers** | ✅ Yes                                    |
| **Used in**               | Variance, standard deviation, covariance |

---

### 💡 Tip:

In data analysis, use **median** instead of mean when your data contains **outliers** (e.g., income, house prices).
