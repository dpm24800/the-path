## Introduction
Among the three characteristics taught by the Buddha, **anicca — impermanence** — is the most commonly mentioned yet the most misunderstood. It is often reduced to a simple idea: “everything changes.” While factually true, this understanding remains superficial and does not touch the liberating insight taught in the early Buddhist texts.

In this article, based on a discussion with **[Ajahn Ñāṇamoli Thero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPmfB2to2sQ)**, we explore the true depth of anicca and how it must be understood on the level of **saṅkhārās** — the underlying structures that determine experience itself.

## 1. The Common but Incorrect View: “Everything Changes”
Many people equate anicca with the observable fact that:
* Things appear
* Things change
* Things pass away

But Ajahn Ñāṇamoli points out that simply seeing change in phenomena does **not** lead to insight. Scientific knowledge, which explains that “everything is changing,” does not free anyone from suffering. Why?

Because it is understood **at the wrong level** — the level of **dhammas** (phenomena), not the level of **saṅkhārās**.

The Buddha did **not** say “all things are impermanent.”
He said:

> sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā — all formations/conditioned constructs are impermanent.

This difference is crucial.

## 2. What Are Saṅkhārās?
**The Hidden Basis of Experience**

Saṅkhārās are not the objects you experience. They are the **determinants**, the underlying structures that make experience possible:

* The living body
* The enduring feeling tone
* The assumption of ownership
* The given field of experience you find yourself in every moment

These cannot be directly stared at. They are the **background**, not the objects.
You discern them **peripherally**, as the enduring condition that supports every moment of experience.

Thus:
* You can sense a sight.
* You can hear a sound.
* But you cannot see the body *as the necessary basis* while you are looking at sights.

Yet the body is **always there first**, enabling everything else.

## 3. The Body as the Primary Saṅkhāra

The Buddha often described the body as:

> “This body, made of the four great elements, procreated by mother and father, built up by food, subject to change, decay, and dissolution.” (MN 77)

The body is:
* Given to you
* Enduring on its own
* Not created by you
* Not under your control

Without it:
* No seeing
* No hearing
* No thinking
* No experience at all

The body is therefore the **primary container** of all experience — the most immediate saṅkhāra.

The sense of ownership (“my body,” “my experience”) sits **on top** of this given container, disguising its instability.

## 4. Why Anicca Leads to Dukkha
When anicca is fully understood at the level of saṅkhārās, a deep emotional realization arises:

* The entire basis of your existence is unstable.
* You depend completely on something you did not create.
* All control is enclosed within a larger field of non-control.

This is why the Buddha said:

> **sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā — all formations are suffering.**

The suffering does not come from “things changing,” but from being **enclosed in an unstable, uncontrollable condition**.

Ajahn Ñāṇamoli compares this to:

**Being buried alive in a coffin with air to breathe.**  
You can move, think, decide, speak —
but never escape the container that holds you.

This image evokes the existential pressure of saṃsāra.

## 5. Craving: The Fuel That Keeps the Cycle Turning
Craving arises **because things have already changed** in a way you dislike.
Examples:

* Pain arises → you want it to stop.
* Pleasure arises → you want it to continue.
* Neutrality feels boring → you want stimulation.

In all cases:
> You react to change with more wanting of change.

Craving tries to escape instability by demanding more instability.
Ajahn compares this to a fish hooked on a line:

* The more it struggles,
* The deeper the hook pierces.

## 6. The Real Way Out
The Buddha did not teach a way to escape the aggregates or the body.
There is **no outside** to sensory experience. You cannot “dig a tunnel” out of your own body.

The true escape is internal:

### Stop resisting the nature of saṅkhārās.
Stop insisting that the unstable must become stable.**

This is achieved through:
* Right View
* Mindfulness of death
* Recognition of non-control
* Gradual dispassion toward craving
* Understanding the emptiness of ownership

When craving ceases:
* The emotional burden lifts.
* The basis is still unstable, but no longer oppressive.
* The heart becomes free.

For an arahant, the aggregates continue merely as a container.
When the body finally breaks apart at death:
- Nibbāna is realized — the complete cessation of saṅkhārās.

## Conclusion
Anicca is not about watching things appear and disappear.
It is about recognizing that the **very foundation of your experience**—the body, feelings, existence itself—is unstable, given, and beyond control.

Seeing this clearly:
* undermines attachment,
* reveals the nature of dukkha, and
* opens the path to dispassion.

When this understanding matures, the mind loses its compulsive need to resist reality.
This is the beginning of liberation.
