In a relational database, a **key** is an attribute (i.e. column), or a set of attributes (columns), whose main job is to **help identify, reference, or relate rows (tuples) in a table (relation)**. More concretely: a key gives each row a (potentially) unique “identity” and enables connecting data across tables. ([Airbyte][1])

Without keys, tables would have no guaranteed way to distinguish between duplicate-looking rows or to safely relate rows across different tables — leading to ambiguity, redundancy, and poor data integrity.

However: **“key” does not always mean “unique identifier among all keys.”** Whether a key ensures uniqueness depends on *which type* of key it is.

## Main Types of Keys in DBMS
Here are the principal key types used in relational databases, along with their definitions and roles. ([BYJU'S][2])

| Key Type   | Definition & Purpose |
| ---------  | ---------------------|
| Super Key | Any set of attributes (one or more columns) that **can uniquely identify** each tuple (row) in the table. A “super key” might contain extra, unnecessary attributes beyond what’s strictly needed. ([Wikipedia][3])|
| Candidate Key | A **minimal** super key — i.e. a smallest set of attributes that still uniquely identifies each row. No subset of a candidate key should itself uniquely identify rows. Tables may have multiple candidate keys. ([Wikipedia][4])|
| Primary Key | One chosen candidate key per table, designated as the main identifier for rows. Must be unique for each row and usually cannot be NULL. Chosen by database designer or DBA. ([Wikipedia][5])|
| Alternate Key (or **Unique Key**) | Candidate keys that were not selected as the primary key. They still uniquely identify each row; databases often enforce them via a `UNIQUE` constraint. Alternate/Unique keys give additional ways to identify or query data. ([Wikipedia][6])|
| **Composite Key** (or Compound Key) | A key made up of **two or more attributes together**. Used when no single column suffices to uniquely identify rows, but the combination does. Composite keys can be candidate, primary, or alternate keys. ([BYJU'S][2])|
| **Foreign Key** | An attribute (or set of attributes) in one table that **references** (points to) the primary key (or candidate key) of another table. Foreign keys are used to **establish relationships between tables** and enforce referential integrity. Not necessarily unique in the referencing table; can repeat or even be NULL (depending on design). ([Wikipedia][7])|
| *(Sometimes)* **Surrogate Key** or **Secondary Key** | A surrogate key is an artificially generated identifier (e.g. auto-increment ID) used when no natural candidate key is suitable. Secondary key often refers to non-key attributes used for indexing or search, and might not guarantee uniqueness. ([upGrad][8])|

## How to Choose Which Key Type to Use — Design Principles
When designing a database table (schema), you usually follow this reasoning:

1. **Find all possible Candidate Keys** — identify the minimal sets of attributes that can uniquely identify each row.
2. **Choose one Candidate Key as Primary Key** — pick the one that’s stable (values won’t change), simple, widely used, and semantically meaningful (or choose a surrogate if needed).
3. **If there are other Candidate Keys, mark them as Alternate/Unique Keys** — to allow alternate ways to look up records.
4. **If no single attribute (column) is enough for uniqueness, use a Composite Key** — e.g. combination of columns.
5. **When you need to link tables, use a Foreign Key** — to refer to the Primary (or Candidate) Key of another table; this helps maintain relationships and data integrity.
6. **Use Surrogate Keys when natural data attributes don’t work —** maybe because they are too big, unwieldy, mutable, or privacy-sensitive.

This disciplined use of keys helps ensure **entity integrity** (each row is unique and identifiable) and **referential integrity** (relations between tables are valid), two core pillars of relational database design. ([Airbyte][1])

## Relationships and Hierarchy Among Key Types
To understand how these key types relate to each other, here’s a conceptual hierarchy:

* **Super Key** — broadest definition: any superset of attributes that uniquely identifies rows.
* **Candidate Key** — minimal super key (no extra attributes).
* From Candidate Keys → choose one → **Primary Key**.
* Other Candidate Keys that are not chosen → **Alternate (or Unique) Keys**.
* You might also have **Composite Keys** (if uniqueness requires multiple columns together).
* To connect tables → **Foreign Key** (references Primary / Candidate Key of another table).

Hence, all candidate keys are super keys; but not all super keys are candidate keys. ([Wikipedia][3])

## Examples to Illustrate Different Keys
Consider a table `STUDENT` with columns: `student_id`, `email`, `phone_number`, `full_name`, `date_of_birth`.

* Suppose `student_id` and `email` are both guaranteed unique. Then `{student_id}` and `{email}` are both **candidate keys**.
* If you choose `student_id` as the **primary key**, then `email` becomes an **alternate key (unique key)**.
* `{student_id, email}` is a valid **super key** (but not minimal, so not candidate).
* If uniqueness needs both `phone_number` **and** `date_of_birth` together (say only together they are unique), then `{phone_number, date_of_birth}` could be a **composite key**.
* A table `ENROLLMENT` might contain `student_id` (referring to STUDENT) and `course_id`. Here `student_id` in `ENROLLMENT` is a **foreign key** referencing `STUDENT(student_id)`.

Such design — using different key types appropriately — avoids duplicates, supports integrity, and allows flexible queries.

## Common Mistakes / Misconceptions About “Key”
Because many of the key types (Primary, Candidate, Unique) guarantee uniqueness, beginners sometimes assume: **“key = unique key always.”** But that’s incorrect.

* A **super key** may include redundant attributes — it's not necessarily minimal.
* A **foreign key** rarely ensures uniqueness in its own table; its job is relational, not unique identification. ([Wikipedia][7])
* A **composite key** might be necessary when no single attribute suffices.
* Using **surrogate keys** (auto-generated IDs) is often safer than using mutable real-world data (like phone number or email) as keys — because real-world data can change, but IDs stay stable.

Understanding these distinctions is vital for good database design.

## Why Understanding Keys Matters — From DB Design to Real Projects
* **Data integrity**: Keys prevent duplicate rows and enforce uniqueness (for candidate/primary/unique keys).
* **Relationships**: Foreign keys establish reliable links between tables — e.g. between users and orders, students and enrollments.
* **Performance & Querying**: Proper keys (especially primary/unique) help indexing, which speeds up lookups.
* **Maintainability & Stability**: Good key design (with surrogate keys or stable natural keys) makes schema evolution easier.
* **Normalization**: Keys help in structuring data to reduce redundancy (e.g. by splitting tables and linking via foreign keys).

Common types include the **primary key**, which uniquely identifies each row, and the **foreign key**, which links tables together by referencing a primary key. Other important keys include the candidate key, super key, unique key, and composite key. 

## Key types and functions: Types of DBMS keys
- **Unique Key** 
  - A key that ensures all values in a column are unique. 
  - similar to a primary key, but can allow for a single NULL value.
  - Ensures that all values in a column are unique. 
  - Like a primary key, it cannot have NULL values, but it is distinct from a primary key as a table can have multiple unique keys.
- **Super Key** 
  - A set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row in a table. 
  - A super key can have additional attributes that are not necessary for unique identification.
- **Candidate Key** 
  - Any attribute or set of attributes that can be used to uniquely identify a row in a table. 
  - A table can have multiple candidate keys, and one is chosen to be the primary key.
  - A candidate key is a minimal super key, meaning it contains the smallest possible number of attributes that still uniquely identify a row.
- **Primary Key** 
  - A column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. 
  - It cannot contain NULL values and must have unique values.
  - It can be an existing attribute or one generated specifically for the database.
- **Composite Key** 
  - A key that consists of two or more columns to uniquely identify a row.
  - A key made up of two or more columns that, when combined, uniquely identify a row. 
  - Also known as a compound key.
- **Foreign Key** 
  - A field in one table that references the primary key of another table. 
  - This is used to link tables together and ensure referential integrity.
  - A column in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. 
  - It is used to establish and enforce a link between the two tables, maintaining referential integrity.

- **Alternate Key**: Any candidate key that was not chosen as the primary key.
- **Surrogate Key**: A key with a system-generated, unique value that has no business meaning. It is often used as the primary key when a natural key is not available or desirable.


## Why keys are important
- **Uniqueness:** They ensure each record is uniquely identifiable, preventing duplicate entries.
- **Data integrity:** They enforce rules that keep data accurate, consistent, and reliable.
- **Relationships:** They establish links between different tables, allowing you to connect related information across the database.
- **Efficiency:** They enable faster and more efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

DBMS keys are attributes or sets of attributes used to uniquely identify records in a table and establish relationships between tables, crucial for data integrity and efficient retrieval. Common types include the **primary key** for unique record identification, the **foreign key** for linking tables, the **candidate key** (a potential primary key), the **super key** (any set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record), the **alternate key** (a candidate key not chosen as the primary key), and the **composite key** (a key made of two or more attributes).
