**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** is a powerful technique for simplifying complex queries, improving readability, and enabling recursive logic. CTEs define a temporary, named result set that exists only for the duration of a single query.

## Syntax
A CTE is always introduced by the `WITH` keyword, followed by the CTE's name, the `AS` keyword, and the defining `SELECT` statement enclosed in parentheses.

### Single CTE Syntax
The most basic structure involves a single CTE followed by the main query that references it:

```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...) AS (  -- Column list is optional
    -- The defining SELECT statement (the temporary result set)
    SELECT col_a, col_b
    FROM source_table
    WHERE condition
)
-- The main query that uses the CTE
SELECT column1, column2
FROM cte_name
WHERE another_condition;
```

### Multiple CTE Syntax
You can chain multiple CTEs together. Subsequent CTEs can refer to previously defined CTEs within the same WITH clause. The CTEs are separated by commas.

```sql
WITH first_cte AS (
    -- Defines the first result set
    SELECT ...
),
second_cte AS (
    -- Defines the second result set, referencing the first_cte
    SELECT *
    FROM first_cte
    WHERE ...
),
third_cte (c3_col1, c3_col2) AS (
    -- Defines the third result set
    SELECT ...
)
-- Main query referencing any of the defined CTEs
SELECT *
FROM second_cte, third_cte
WHERE ...;
```

## Practical Examples

Let's use a sample table called `Employees` for these examples:

| EmployeeID | Name | DepartmentID | Salary | ManagerID |
| :---:       | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 101 | Alice | 1 | 70000 | 104 |
| 102 | Bob | 2 | 65000 | 104 |
| 103 | Charlie | 1 | 80000 | 105 |
| 104 | David | 3 | 95000 | NULL |
| 105 | Eve | 2 | 75000 | 104 |
| 106 | Fiona | 3 | 110000 | 105 |

### 1. Simplifying Subqueries with a Single CTE
Instead of using a non-reusable subquery in the FROM clause, a CTE provides a clear name for the logic.

**Goal:** Find all employees whose salary is above the average salary for their respective department.

```sql
WITH DepartmentAverage AS (
    -- CTE to calculate the average salary for each department
    SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgDepartmentSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY DepartmentID
)
SELECT e.Name, e.Salary, d.AvgDepartmentSalary
FROM Employees e
JOIN DepartmentAverage d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.Salary > d.AvgDepartmentSalary;
```

  * **Without CTE:** This would require calculating the `DepartmentAverage` in a subquery and joining to it, or using an expensive correlated subquery in the WHERE clause. The CTE makes the logic easy to follow: first, get the average, then use it to filter the employees.

-----

### 2. Chaining CTEs for Step-by-Step Logic

CTEs are excellent for multi-step processing where the output of one step is the input for the next.

**Goal:** First, get the list of high-earning managers (salary $\ge$ 90000), and then find all employees who report to those specific high-earning managers.

```sql
WITH HighEarningManagers AS (
    -- Step 1: Identify managers earning $90,000 or more
    SELECT EmployeeID AS ManagerID, Name AS ManagerName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary >= 90000
),
EmployeeDetails AS (
    -- Step 2: Join HighEarningManagers with the Employees table
    -- to find their direct reports.
    SELECT e.Name AS EmployeeName, e.Salary AS EmployeeSalary, m.ManagerName
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN HighEarningManagers m ON e.ManagerID = m.ManagerID
)
-- Final Query: Select the required information
SELECT EmployeeName, EmployeeSalary, ManagerName
FROM EmployeeDetails
ORDER BY ManagerName, EmployeeSalary DESC;
```

  * **Clarity:** The chained CTEs clearly delineate the two logical steps: finding the managers, then finding their reports.

### 3. Recursive CTEs for Hierarchical Data

The WITH clause is **mandatory** for **recursive queries** using the WITH RECURSIVE keyword. This is typically used to traverse organizational charts, bill of materials, or network paths.

**Goal:** Trace the full management hierarchy, starting from an employee with EmployeeID = 101 up to the top-level manager (ManagerID is NULL).

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE OrganizationHierarchy AS (
    -- Anchor Member (The initial starting point for the recursion)
    SELECT EmployeeID, Name, ManagerID, 1 AS Level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE EmployeeID = 101

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive Member (Iterates by joining the CTE to the Employees table)
    SELECT
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.Name,
        e.ManagerID,
        o.Level + 1 AS Level
    FROM
        Employees e
    JOIN
        OrganizationHierarchy o ON e.EmployeeID = o.ManagerID
)
-- Main query to display the result set
SELECT
    EmployeeID,
    Name,
    ManagerID,
    Level
FROM
    OrganizationHierarchy;
```

  * **Anchor Member:** The first SELECT statement provides the initial row(s) for the result set and is executed once.
  * **`UNION ALL`:** The operator that connects the anchor and recursive members.
  * **Recursive Member:** The second SELECT statement, which references the CTE itself (OrganizationHierarchy), is repeatedly executed until it returns an empty result set (i.e., when ManagerID is NULL).
  * **Note:** The exact syntax for recursive CTEs can vary slightly between database systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server).

----- -->

## Key Rules and Considerations
* **Scope**: A CTE is temporary and can **only** be used within the single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE statement immediately following the WITH clause. It cannot be referenced by other, separate queries.
* **No Indexing**: Since a CTE is not physically stored, you cannot create indexes on it.
* **Performance vs. Readability**: While CTEs are highly valuable for readability and complexity management, they **do not necessarily improve query performance** over an equivalent subquery. In most modern SQL systems, the query optimizer treats CTEs and subqueries similarly. If a CTE is referenced multiple times, however, some database systems may re-execute the CTE's defining query for each reference (unless materialized or optimized otherwise), which *could* hurt performance.
* **Data Modification**: You can use a CTE to define the rows to be affected by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, making complex modifications clearer.

```sql
-- Example: Delete employees who report to a specific manager
WITH EmployeesToDelete AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID
    FROM Employees
    WHERE
        ManagerID = 104
)
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID IN (SELECT EmployeeID FROM EmployeesToDelete);
```
