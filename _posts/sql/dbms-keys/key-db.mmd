    subgraph Key Definitions and Examples
        A[Super Key: <br/>EmployeeID, Email, NationalID, <br/>(EmployeeID + Email, etc.)]
        B[Candidate Key: <br/>EmployeeID, Email, NationalID]
        C(Primary Key: <br/>EmployeeID)
        D(Alternate Key: <br/>Email, NationalID)
        E{Unique Key: <br/>Email, NationalID}
        F[Foreign Key: <br/>DepartmentID <br/>→ Departments(DepartmentID)]
        G[Composite Key: <br/>EmployeeID + ProjectID]
        H[Surrogate Key: <br/>EmployeeID (auto-increment)]
    end

    %% Hierarchy/Relationships based on typical logic
    
    %% Super Key to Candidate Key (Minimality)
    A -- contains minimal --> B
    
    %% Candidate Key split (Selection)
    B -- chosen as --> C
    B -- remaining as --> D
    
    %% PK and AK are types of Candidate Keys
    C -- is a type of --> E
    D -- is a type of --> E

    %% PK is referenced by FK
    C -- referenced by --> F
    
    %% Composite and Surrogate are types/attributes of a Primary Key
    G -- is often a type of --> C
    H -- is often a type of --> C

    %% Additional Links observed in the SVG's arrows, interpreted as dependencies:
    %% The link from PK (C) to FK (F) in the original SVG is maintained as reference.
    %% The link from Composite Key (G) to Surrogate Key (H) is unusual but mapped:
    G --> H
