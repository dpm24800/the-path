<!-- Definition → Key Points → Example → Key Examples → Relationship Summary. -->

In relational database, a key is one or more attributes (columns/fields) that:
- Uniquely identify each row in a table (relation) — ensuring entity integrity (no duplicate rows).
- Establish and enforce relationships between tables — ensuring referential integrity (valid references between related data).

<!-- In a relation (table) or relational database, a **key** is one or more (group/set of) attributes (columns/fields) that, 
  - uniquely identify each row in a table (i.e. maintains data integrity) and
  - establish relationships between tables (i.e. maintains referential integrity).   -->

More concretely: a key gives each row a (potentially) unique “identity” and enables connecting data across tables. 

<!-- ([Airbyte][1]) -->

Without keys, tables would have no guaranteed way to distinguish between duplicate-looking rows or to safely relate rows across different tables — leading to ambiguity, redundancy, and poor data integrity.

However: **"key"** does not always mean "unique identifier among all keys". Whether a key ensures uniqueness depends on *which type* of key it is.

## 1. Major Types of Keys
Here are the principal key types used in relational databases,

 <!-- along with their definitions and roles. ([BYJU'S][2]) -->

### 1. Super Key
A *Super Key* is a set of one or more columns that can *uniquely identify each row* in a table. 
It may contain extra columns that are not necessary for uniqueness.

**Key Points:**
1. Can consist of *one or multiple columns*.
2. Must *uniquely identify each row*.
3. May contain *extra columns*, making it *non-minimal*.
4. A *Candidate Key = Minimal Super Key*.
5. Primary and alternate keys are subsets of super keys.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT,                
    Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,   
    NationalID VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Examples of Super Keys
-- EmployeeID alone
-- Email alone
-- NationalID alone
-- Combination: (EmployeeID, Email)
-- Combination: (EmployeeID, Name)
```

**Key Examples from Code:**

* `(EmployeeID)`
* `(Email)`
* `(NationalID)`
* `(EmployeeID, Email)` – still unique, but not minimal

**Relationship Summary:**
* Super Key → Candidate Key → Primary/Alternate Key
* Candidate Keys are *minimal super keys*
* All candidate keys are super keys

### 2. Candidate Key
- A *Candidate Key* is a *minimal set of columns that can uniquely identify each row*. 
- It is a Super Key without extra attributes.

**Key Points:**
1. Must *uniquely identify each row*.
2. Must be *minimal*.
3. A table can have *multiple candidate keys*.
4. One candidate key becomes the *Primary Key*.
5. Others become *Alternate Keys*.

**Example: SQL Code with Comments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT,                
    Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,   
    NationalID VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);

-- Primary Key
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID);

-- Alternate Keys (other candidate keys)
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD UNIQUE (Email);
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD UNIQUE (NationalID);
```

**Key Examples from Code:**

* Candidate Keys: `EmployeeID`, `Email`, `NationalID`
* Primary Key: `EmployeeID`
* Alternate Keys: `Email`, `NationalID`

**Relationship Summary:**

* Candidate Key = Minimal Super Key
* Primary Key = chosen candidate key
* Alternate Keys = other candidate keys
* All candidate and alternate keys are unique keys

---

### 3. Primary Key
A *Primary Key* is a column or set of columns *chosen from candidate keys* to uniquely identify each row in the table.

**Key Points:**
1. Must be *unique* and *not null*.
2. Only *one primary key per table*.
3. Can be a *single column or composite (multi-column)*.
4. Used for *referencing in foreign keys*.

**Example: SQL Code with Comments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,    -- Primary Key uniquely identifies each row
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    DepartmentID INT
);
```

**Key Examples from Code:**

* Primary Key: `EmployeeID`

**Relationship Summary:**

* Primary Key is a *candidate key chosen for uniqueness*
* Other candidate keys become *alternate keys*
* Can be referenced by *foreign keys*

---

### 4. Alternate Key

**Definition:**
An *Alternate Key* is a *candidate key that was not chosen as the primary key* but can still uniquely identify rows.

**Key Points:**

1. Must *uniquely identify rows*.
2. Cannot be the primary key.
3. Usually enforced using *UNIQUE constraints*.

**Example: SQL Code with Comments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,    -- Alternate Key
    NationalID VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL -- Alternate Key
);

-- Enforce uniqueness for alternate keys
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD UNIQUE (Email);
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD UNIQUE (NationalID);
```

**Key Examples from Code:**

* Alternate Keys: `Email`, `NationalID`

**Relationship Summary:**

* Alternate Keys = Candidate Keys not chosen as Primary Key
* All alternate keys are *unique keys*

---

### 5. Unique Key
A Unique Key is a constraint that ensures all values in a column or combination of columns are unique.

**Key Points:**
1. Ensures *no duplicate values*.
2. Can exist *in addition to primary key*.
3. Can allow *one NULL value* (depending on DBMS).
4. Can be single-column or multi-column.

**Example: SQL Code with Comments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,      -- Unique Key
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE  -- Another Unique Key
);
```

**Key Examples from Code:**

* Unique Keys: `Email`, `PhoneNumber`

**Relationship Summary:**

* Unique Key can be an *Alternate Key*
* Primary Key is always *unique*
* Can exist *independently* of candidate/alternate keys

---

### 6. Foreign Key
A *Foreign Key* is a column or set of columns in one table that *references the primary key of another table*, enforcing *referential integrity*.

**Key Points:**
1. Ensures *referential integrity* between tables.
2. Values must exist in the referenced table.
3. Can have *cascading actions* (`ON DELETE/UPDATE`).

**Example: SQL Code with Comments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);
```

**Key Examples from Code:**

* Foreign Key: `DepartmentID` in `Employees` references `DepartmentID` in `Departments`

**Relationship Summary:**

* Foreign Key points to a *Primary Key in another table*
* Used to *maintain relationships* between tables

---

### 7. Composite Key
- A *Composite Key* is a *primary key made of two or more columns*. 
- It uniquely identifies rows when a single column cannot.

**Key Points:**
1. Must *uniquely identify each row*.
2. Composed of *multiple columns*.
3. Often used in *junction/many-to-many tables*.

**Example: SQL Code with Comments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeProjects (
    EmployeeID INT,
    ProjectID INT,
    AssignedDate DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID, ProjectID) -- Composite Key
);
```

**Key Examples from Code:**

* Composite Key: `(EmployeeID, ProjectID)`

**Relationship Summary:**

* Composite Key = Multi-column Primary Key
* Ensures uniqueness across the combination of columns
* Can be referenced by *foreign keys* in other tables

Ah, yes! You’re right — we haven’t covered *Surrogate Key* yet. Let’s add it in the *same detailed format* as the other keys.

### 8. Surrogate Key
- A Surrogate Key is a *system-generated unique identifier* for a row, often used as a primary key instead of a natural candidate key. 
- It has *no business meaning* and exists purely to identify rows uniquely.

**Key Points:**
1. Typically an *auto-increment number* or *UUID*.
2. Has *no real-world meaning* (unlike natural keys such as Email or NationalID).
3. Often used when *natural keys are long, complex, or composite*.
4. Helps maintain *simplicity and consistency* in database relationships.
5. Can still be used in *foreign key references*.

**Example: SQL Code with Comments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, -- Surrogate Key: system-generated unique ID
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,                 -- Natural key
    NationalID VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE             -- Natural key
);
```

* Here, `EmployeeID` is a *Surrogate Key*:
  * Auto-incremented, system-generated, no business meaning.
  * Ensures every employee has a *unique identifier*.
* `Email` and `NationalID` are *natural candidate keys* (can also serve as alternate keys).

**Key Examples from Code:**
* Surrogate Key: `EmployeeID`
* Candidate Keys (natural): `Email`, `NationalID`
* Primary Key: `EmployeeID` (surrogate key chosen over natural keys)

**Relationship Summary:**
* Surrogate Key is a *special type of primary key*.
* It replaces natural candidate keys when simpler or system-generated keys are preferred.
* Can be referenced by *foreign keys* in other tables.
* Alternate keys (natural candidate keys) can still exist for uniqueness constraints.
