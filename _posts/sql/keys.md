The hierarchy of keys in a DBMS visually organizes how different types of keys relate to each other based on their properties and roles. The core relationship is that **all keys that uniquely identify a record are a subset of the Super Key**. 

Hierarchy and Relationships of DBMS Keys

The following chart illustrates the containment hierarchy of the primary keys used for unique identification within a single table: 

- **Super Key**: The most general type of key. It is any combination of attributes (one or more) that can uniquely identify a row (tuple) in a table.
  - Example: In a table with `(ID, Name, Phone)`, `(ID)`, `(ID, Name)`, and `(ID, Name, Phone)` are all Super Keys.
- **Candidate Key**: A **minimal** super key; it has no redundant attributes. If you remove any attribute from a candidate key, it can no longer uniquely identify a row.
  - Example: Both `(ID)` and `(Phone)` might be candidate keys if both are unique identifiers. `(ID, Name)` is a Super Key but not a Candidate Key because `(ID)` alone is sufficient.
- **Primary Key**: The specific candidate key chosen by the database designer to be the main unique identifier for a table. A table can only have one primary key, and it cannot contain NULL values.
- **Alternate Key**: Any candidate key that was not selected to be the primary key. 

Other Key Types (Related but Outside the Main Hierarchy)

These keys serve different functions, often for linking tables or specific data integrity constraints: 

- **Foreign Key**: An attribute or set of attributes in one table that references the primary key (or another candidate key) of another table. This key is crucial for establishing and managing relationships between different tables and maintaining referential integrity.
- **Composite Key**: Any key (super, candidate, or primary) that consists of two or more attributes. This is a classification of a key's *structure*, not its hierarchical relationship to other keys.
- **Unique Key**: A constraint that ensures all values in a column (or set of columns) are distinct. It is similar to a primary key but can allow one NULL value and a table can have multiple unique keys.
- **Surrogate Key**: An artificial key, often a simple integer value generated by the system (like an auto-incrementing ID), that has no business meaning but is used as the primary key when natural keys are complex or absent.
- **Partial Key (Discriminator)**: An attribute of a weak entity set that, when combined with the primary key of its owner (strong entity set), uniquely identifies the weak entity.
- **Secondary Key**: Used for indexing purposes to speed up data retrieval, though it does not necessarily enforce uniqueness.
