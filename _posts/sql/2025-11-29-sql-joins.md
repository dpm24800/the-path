SQL JOIN clauses combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them, creating a single result set.

This is fundamental for working with relational databases where data is often distributed across multiple tables to maintain normalization and avoid redundancy.



Here are the main types of SQL JOINs:

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables based on the specified join condition. Rows without a match in either table are excluded.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table (the first table in the FROM clause) and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match in the right table, NULL values are returned for the right table's columns.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN**: 

  Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. 

  If there is no match in the left table, NULL values are returned for the left table's columns.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**: 

  Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or the right table. 

  If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the columns of the table that lacks a match. 

  This combines the results of a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2 
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- **CROSS JOIN**: 
  Produces the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table. 

  This type of join typically does not have an ON clause.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

- **SELF JOIN**: A regular join where a table is joined with itself. This is useful for comparing rows within the same table, often used with aliases to distinguish between the two instances of the table.

```sql
SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name
FROM table_name a, table_name b
WHERE a.column_name = b.column_name;
```
